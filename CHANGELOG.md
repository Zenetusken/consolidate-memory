# Changelog

All notable changes to **consolidate-memory** are documented here. This project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may make
breaking changes). Installed plugins auto-update at Claude Code startup when this
version changes on `main`.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Network token attribution.** `sync_global.py --tokens` + the dashboard now report
  `mirror_index_tokens` — the share of each node's always-loaded index driven by
  replicated `global_ref:` cross-project mirrors — so a mirror-dominated over-budget
  index points at the right lever (demote/GC the canonical in the global store, not a
  futile local prune that just re-pulls).
- **User-global `CLAUDE.md` observability.** `memory_status.py` measures
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` **read-only** and the dashboard shows it as a distinct
  "every project · read-only" line, so the per-session always-loaded cost isn't
  understated. The skill never writes that file.
- **`render_dashboard.py --demo`** — paste-free preview of the dashboard from a
  built-in sample record.
- **Auto-gated ANSI color** in the dashboard: on only when stdout is a TTY and
  `NO_COLOR` is unset (`--color=auto|always|never`); captured/piped output stays plain.

### Changed
- **Dashboard redesign** for readability: one coherent column grid, budget bars,
  UPPERCASE section anchors, dimmed in-row field labels (color only), self-labelling
  name-forward Changes rows (a skipped entry reads `· skipped <name>` — no stray `—`),
  and bracketed citations.
- **`CLAUDE.md` guest posture.** The skill defaults to *not* writing the project
  `CLAUDE.md` — facts route to auto-memory or `AGENTS.md`/`MEMORY.md`; only a genuine
  always-loaded *convention* earns a surgical, in-style line; never create or
  reorganize one; propose (don't perform) trims of user-authored lines. The user-global
  `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is strictly read-only.

### Fixed
- **Recall-tier accuracy.** Removed the claim (SKILL.md, harness-map.md, README.md)
  that fact bodies are auto-surfaced by `description:` match — Claude Code has no such
  ambient recall; bodies are read on-demand. Reframed: the `description:` is the
  always-loaded **index hook** that cues an on-demand read. Design unchanged
  (description-as-recall-key still correct; it *is* the hook).
- **Render hardening.** The dashboard now coerces every *model-authored* cycle-record
  value (`_num`/`_clean`) at the network + changes presentation boundary, matching the
  budget rows — a string/`null` numeric or wrong-typed `tier`/`store` can no longer
  crash `render()`. Schema block (`SKILL.md`) updated in lockstep with the seed +
  renderer (`budget.global_claude_md`, `network.*.mirror_index_tokens`).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-16

### Added
- `tests/validate_manifests.py` — zero-dependency manifest validator (schema, kebab-case
  names, relative source path, semver) usable anywhere Python runs (no `claude` CLI).

### Changed
- Release process: a local maintainer harness now cuts releases (version bump → validate
  → tag → GitHub Release). Updates reach users via the bumped `version` landing on `main`.
- The multi-agent DevSecOps pentest harness and its findings are now local-only
  maintainer artifacts (not published); `SECURITY.md` remains the public security record.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-16

First public release as a **Claude Code plugin**, distributed via a plugin marketplace.

### Added
- **Plugin packaging.** Installable with `/plugin marketplace add
  Zenetusken/consolidate-memory` + `/plugin install consolidate-memory@zenetusken-plugins`
  — no clone, no symlinks. Self-hosted marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
  with the plugin under `plugins/consolidate-memory/` (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
  SKILL.md references its scripts via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
- **Network token observability.** `sync_global.py --tokens` + a dashboard
  "Neural network — token consumption (all nodes)" sub-section: per-node and total
  estimated (≈ chars/4) always-loaded + recall-pool token cost across the shared-memory
  network, plus what each cycle did in lifecycle terms on the triggering node.
- **Memory-lifecycle bounding.** Encoded always-loaded token budgets
  (`INDEX_TOKEN_BUDGET` / `CLAUDE_MD_TOKEN_BUDGET`) with an over-budget ⚠; orphan
  garbage collection (`sync_global.py --gc [--apply]`); index-pointer **upsert** so the
  always-loaded hook tracks the canonical; a re-verification signal for facts untouched
  since the marker.
- **DevSecOps security gate.** A reusable multi-agent white-hat pentest cycle (recon →
  parallel per-surface pentesters with loop-until-dry → 3-vote adversarial verification →
  severity-ranked go/no-go gate) gates each release. Final gate: PASS (0 High/Critical).
- `SECURITY.md` (threat model + enforced security properties + disclosure).

### Security
- Stdlib-only, no network, no `eval`/`exec`/`shell=True`; the only external process is
  read-only `git` invoked with a fixed argument list.
- **Argument-injection guard:** the commit SHA read from the on-disk state file is
  hex-validated before reaching `git` (`memory_status._valid_sha`).
- **Input bounding:** transcript turns are length-capped before regex classification
  (defense-in-depth); secrets firewall drops credential-shaped turns at retrieval.
- The personal `memory/` store is gitignored and excluded from the published plugin.

### Changed
- `install.sh` is now a **maintainer dev-install** (registers a local marketplace +
  installs the plugin) rather than a user-skill symlinker — the symlink model is retired
  because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only set when loading as a plugin.
- Docs (README, CLAUDE.md, harness-map) updated to the plugin layout.
