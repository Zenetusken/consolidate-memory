# Changelog

All notable changes to **consolidate-memory** are documented here. This project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: minor versions may make
breaking changes).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-16

First public release as a **Claude Code plugin**, distributed via a plugin marketplace.

### Added
- **Plugin packaging.** Installable with `/plugin marketplace add
  Zenetusken/consolidate-memory` + `/plugin install consolidate-memory@zenetusken-plugins`
  — no clone, no symlinks. Self-hosted marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
  with the plugin under `plugins/consolidate-memory/` (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
  SKILL.md references its scripts via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`.
- **Network token observability.** `sync_global.py --tokens` + a dashboard
  "Neural network — token consumption (all nodes)" sub-section: per-node and total
  estimated (≈ chars/4) always-loaded + recall-pool token cost across the shared-memory
  network, plus what each cycle did in lifecycle terms on the triggering node.
- **Memory-lifecycle bounding.** Encoded always-loaded token budgets
  (`INDEX_TOKEN_BUDGET` / `CLAUDE_MD_TOKEN_BUDGET`) with an over-budget ⚠; orphan
  garbage collection (`sync_global.py --gc [--apply]`); index-pointer **upsert** so the
  always-loaded hook tracks the canonical; a re-verification signal for facts untouched
  since the marker.
- **DevSecOps security gate.** `security/devsecops.workflow.js` — a reusable multi-agent
  white-hat pentest cycle (recon → parallel per-surface pentesters with loop-until-dry →
  3-vote adversarial verification → severity-ranked go/no-go gate).
- `SECURITY.md` (threat model + enforced security properties + disclosure) and
  `PREFLIGHT.md` (go-live checklist).

### Security
- Stdlib-only, no network, no `eval`/`exec`/`shell=True`; the only external process is
  read-only `git` invoked with a fixed argument list.
- **Argument-injection guard:** the commit SHA read from the on-disk state file is
  hex-validated before reaching `git` (`memory_status._valid_sha`).
- **Input bounding:** transcript turns are length-capped before regex classification
  (defense-in-depth); secrets firewall drops credential-shaped turns at retrieval.
- The personal `memory/` store is gitignored and excluded from the published plugin.

### Changed
- `install.sh` is now a **maintainer dev-install** (registers a local marketplace +
  installs the plugin) rather than a user-skill symlinker — the symlink model is retired
  because `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only set when loading as a plugin.
- Docs (README, CLAUDE.md, harness-map) updated to the plugin layout.
